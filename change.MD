## Following the v3 release 
Saturn will no longer use Vannrith Startpage (Simple) as base. This change will make it easier to add features, fix bugs and 
should improve the overall performance quite a bit. These changes might make Saturn a little bit less stable than before but nothing major.

## FAQ


## Will this change remove my favorites links?
Most likely yes, the local storage variable used to store favorites will be changed, thus removing all favorites along with it.

## Will this version improve saturn for mobile use?
Yes, this is one of main reason why I'm completely rewriting saturn.

## Will Saturn get a redesign?
Yes and no, some features like Apps list and favorites will get a complete overhaul but apart from those everything will stay the same. The biggest change will be in the backend where I plan to rewrite most of the CSS to Sass or something else and completely rewrite the Main html file.

## Chrome support?
V3 will come with chrome support out of the box. 

## When will it release?
Currently I don't have a proper release date, but it will probably be around November or December of this year.
